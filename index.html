    <p class="first">Who am I?</p>
    <p>My name is Hilma and I turned 21 in june, the 6th to be exact!</p>
    <p>I am originally from the city of Västerås, so not Jönköping. I moved here, with my cat Stella, about two months ago to start studying this programme here.</p>
<p>I chose New Media Design as I am interested in web development and find it very fun, at most times...I also reallly wanted my education to be in english, which is why this one was a perfect fit!</p>

    <p class="first">My hobbies!</p>
    <p>In my free time I enjoy working out a lot! I have practiced gymnasitcs my whole life and that is something I absolutely love, so for me it's important to keep doing it in some way.</p>
    <p>I also love hanging out with my friends and family, mostly my sisters. They're the ones in the picture together with me down below. They really are the best thing in my life and I always have the best time whenever I'm with them <3 </p>

    <p class="first">My last column</p>
    <p>I am really exited for this course as it is something I am interested in, as mentioned before.</p>
    <p>But am also have to admit I am very nervous as it seems hard and of course very complicated at times, but I'm super sure it will be a very good, information-packed and valuable course! </p>
