    <p>This is a stylization I made of the TV-show Stranger Things. I wanted to showcase the real world as well as the Upside-down world that exist in their cinematic universe. 
    I also included the christmas lights that Will used in season 1 and that also play a pretty big part throughout all of the seasons!
